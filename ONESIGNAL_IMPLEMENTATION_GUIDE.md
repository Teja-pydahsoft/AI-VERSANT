**REST API Key**: `os_v2_app_5yre63dqyrcbjealykb5wxvbcte5xjdzhcwe444yjrysgtey5iieocwzdwaygyaoquueruzocxu5mojtpdxkzvrivtaw7vekg24ut7a`

### Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
# OneSignal Configuration
ONESIGNAL_APP_ID=ee224f6c-70c4-4414-900b-c283db5ea114
ONESIGNAL_REST_API_KEY=os_v2_app_5yre63dqyrcbjealykb5wxvbcte5xjdzhcwe444yjrysgtey5iieocwzdwaygyaoquueruzocxu5mojtpdxkzvrivtaw7vekg24ut7a
```

## üöÄ Features

### 1. Automatic User Subscription
- Users are automatically subscribed when they visit the application
- Player IDs are stored in the database
- User tags are set for segmentation (role, campus, course, etc.)

### 2. Admin Notification Controls
- **Test Notifications**: Send test notifications to current user
- **User Notifications**: Send notifications to specific users
- **Role Notifications**: Send notifications to users with specific roles
- **Broadcast Notifications**: Send notifications to all subscribed users

### 3. Notification Types
- **Test Notifications**: For testing the system
- **User-Specific**: Targeted to individual users
- **Role-Based**: Targeted to user roles (student, admin, etc.)
- **Broadcast**: Sent to all subscribed users

### 4. Rich Notifications
- Custom titles and messages
- Action buttons
- Custom icons and badges
- Deep linking support
- Data payload support

## üì± Frontend Implementation

### Service Worker
The OneSignal service worker (`OneSignalSDKWorker.js`) handles:
- Push event processing
- Notification display
- Click event handling
- Background sync

### OneSignal Service
The `oneSignalService.js` provides:
- SDK initialization
- User subscription management
- Notification sending
- User tagging
- Statistics retrieval

### Integration Component
The `OneSignalIntegration.jsx` component:
- Automatically initializes OneSignal
- Handles user subscription
- Sets up user tags
- Works in the background

## üîß Backend Implementation

### API Endpoints

#### User Endpoints
- `POST /api/onesignal/subscribe` - Subscribe user to notifications
- `POST /api/onesignal/unsubscribe` - Unsubscribe user from notifications

#### Admin Endpoints
- `POST /api/onesignal/test` - Send test notification
- `POST /api/onesignal/broadcast` - Send broadcast notification
- `POST /api/onesignal/send-to-user` - Send notification to specific user
- `POST /api/onesignal/send-to-role` - Send notification to role users
- `GET /api/onesignal/stats` - Get notification statistics
- `GET /api/onesignal/config` - Get OneSignal configuration

### Database Integration
- User player IDs are stored in the `users` collection
- Subscription timestamps are tracked
- Role-based segmentation is supported

## üß™ Testing

### Testing Interface
Access the OneSignal testing interface at:
- **Super Admin**: `/superadmin/push-notification-test`
- **Campus Admin**: `/campus-admin/push-notification-test`

### Test Features
- **Status Check**: Verify OneSignal initialization and subscription status
- **Subscribe/Unsubscribe**: Test user subscription management
- **Test Notification**: Send test notifications
- **Admin Controls**: Send notifications to users, roles, or all users
- **Statistics**: View notification statistics and analytics

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Statistics Available
- Total subscribed users
- Subscription breakdown by role
- Recent subscriptions (last 7 days)
- Notification delivery rates
- User engagement metrics

### Logging
- All OneSignal operations are logged
- Error tracking and debugging
- Performance monitoring

## üîí Security

### Authentication
- All admin endpoints require JWT authentication
- Role-based access control
- Permission-based endpoint access

### Data Protection
- User data is encrypted in transit
- Player IDs are securely stored
- No sensitive data in notification payloads

## üöÄ Deployment

### Frontend Deployment
1. Ensure OneSignal SDK is loaded in `index.html`
2. Service worker is accessible at `/OneSignalSDKWorker.js`
3. OneSignal service is properly initialized

### Backend Deployment
1. Set OneSignal environment variables
2. Register OneSignal routes in `main.py`
3. Ensure database connection for user management

### Production Considerations
- Use HTTPS for OneSignal to work properly
- Set up proper CORS configuration
- Monitor notification delivery rates
- Set up error alerting

## üìà Performance

### Optimization Features
- Lazy loading of OneSignal SDK
- Efficient user tagging
- Background subscription management
- Cached notification statistics

### Scalability
- Supports unlimited users
- Efficient database queries
- Role-based segmentation
- Batch notification sending

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Notifications not showing**
   - Check browser notification permissions
   - Verify OneSignal App ID is correct
   - Ensure service worker is registered

2. **Subscription fails**
   - Check OneSignal REST API key
   - Verify user authentication
   - Check network connectivity

3. **Admin notifications not sending**
   - Verify admin permissions
   - Check OneSignal API limits
   - Ensure user is subscribed

### Debug Tools
- Browser developer console
- OneSignal dashboard
- Backend logs
- Network tab for API calls
